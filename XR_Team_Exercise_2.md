<h1 style="text-align: center;">Team Exercise #2</h1>

<p style="text-align: center;">David Kallemeyn</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Spring 2025</p>

**Due:** 4/16/2025 by 10:00 PM 

**Submission:** github repo link uploaded in canvas (can use the same repo you used for Team Exercise #1). The repo should contain your **team_ex_2.py** file and documentation of your process (you can use github, this document, a readme file, or other method).

**Assignment type:** Team, In-class 

**Points:** Complete/Incomplete. No points are assigned. Extra credit points may be awarded to teams based on their approach and solutions. 

#### INSTRUCTIONS
The file **team_ex_2.py** contains a naive solution to the Pair Exercise #4 assignment, which you are familiar with having recently submitted a solution. The code uses the _wikipedia_ package and downloads references for related pages to a specified topic. This file has 5 functions: 
1. convert_to_str - a helper function to convert objects to strings
2. wiki_sequentially - execute the task sequentially 
3. concurrent_threads - execute using multiple threads
4. dl_and_save_process - helper function for multiple process execution
5. concurrent_process - execute using multiple processes

General advice/resources:
- you will need a virtual environment with the wikipedia package installed
- wrapper functions or other abstractions may be useful

## Problem
Your task is to review the code in the **team_ex_2.py** file, discuss it as a team, and refactor the code to be more efficient and extendable. Your review process should include:
- identification of possible issues
- creation of tasks
- assignment of tasks
- description of each issue and how it was resolved 

In addition to issues/areas for improvement discovered in the codebase, the refactored solution must add the following new functionality:
- allow the user to input their own search term
- if the user input search term is less than 4 characters, default to "generative artificial intelligence"
- a new directory named "wiki_dl" is created to store the .txt files
